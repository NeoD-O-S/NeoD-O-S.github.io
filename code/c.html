<h1>C Language</h1>
<h2>About it</h2>
<p>C is a general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is widely known for its efficiency, flexibility, and control over system resources. C allows programmers to write low-level code for hardware interaction while also supporting high-level abstractions.</p>
<p>Many modern programming languages, such as C++, C#, and Java, have been influenced by C. It is commonly used in operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. Learning C helps developers understand how computers work at a fundamental level and provides a strong foundation for mastering other languages.</p>
