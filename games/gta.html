 <h1>Grand Theft Auto | Mods & Tutorials</h1>
    <p>First of all, when I say <strong>Mod</strong>, I'm saying about <strong>Modifications</strong>.</p>
   <h2>GTA 3</h2>
   <h3>Mods</h3>
   <h4>Installation Guide</h4>
   <p>First of all, you'll need to know that GTA 3 is a old game and it has some limitantions, because of that, we will install Essentials, which will fix some bugs and add support to mods installations, let's continue:</p>
   <p>We will Download Essentials in this <a href="https://libertycity.net/files/gta-3/221158-essentials-mod-pack.html">SITE</a></p>
   <p>Go down and click in the Download button:</p>
   <img src="GTA3_1.PNG"/>
   <p>Then it will open a little tab down here, click in this other download button:</p>
   <img src="GTA3_2.PNG"/>
   <p>Go down and wait while the timer goes to 0</p>
   <img src="GTA3_3.PNG"/>
   <p>And finally click in this final download button:</p>
   <img src="GTA3_4.PNG"/>
   <p>It will download automatically and will appear the password to the .zip, DON'T FORGET IT!</p>
   <p>Now, you will have the .zip</p>
   <img src="GTA3_5.PNG"/>
   <p>Right button in the file, click "Extract here"</p>
   <img src="GTA3_6.PNG"/>
   <p>It will ask for a password, write the password that was in the site (In my case it was "libertycity")</p>
   <img src="GTA3_7.PNG"/>
   <p>It will now have another .zip, extract this file in some folder and you will have these files:</p>
   <img src="GTA3_8.PNG"/>
   <p>Press Ctrl + A and then right button in the files, in this menu click "Cut"</p>
   <img src="GTA3_9.PNG"/>
   <p>It's the final step! go to your GTA 3 folder and then paste it.</p> 
   <img src="GTA3_10.PNG"/>
   <p>Now you can put your mods in your GTA 3!, just be sure to put all the mods in the modloader folder (if it needs to be there)</p> 
   <h5>Example: Using a mod</h5>
   <p>An example is <a href="https://libertycity.net/files/gta-3/228222-gta-3-menu-mod-gta-v-style-loading.html">GTA V Menu Style to GTA 3</a>, do all the steps i did until the last one, that you'll need to paste it in modloader folder (Warning: the mod files need to be in a folder, so the files will be in modloader/modname)</p>
   <p>If it works, congratulations, now you have mods in your gta 3!</p>
